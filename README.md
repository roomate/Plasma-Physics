# Plasma Physics

This repo stores some numerical experiments previously made when I followed courses on this topic.

You can find:

- A notebook on dispersion relations in ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and incompressible Hall-MHD model. It discuss Taylor's hypothesis.
- A project on a plasma for propulsor. They become more and more popular nowadays on small spacecrafts. It compares three candidates rare gas, krypton, argon and xenon, to ionize and accelerate via an electrostatic grid.
