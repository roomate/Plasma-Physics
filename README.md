# Plasma Physics

This repo stores some numerical experiments previously made when I followed courses on this topic.

You can find:

- A notebook on dispersion relations in linear ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It discuss Taylor's hypothesis.
- A project on a plasma propulsor. They become more and more popular nowadays on small spacecrafts.
